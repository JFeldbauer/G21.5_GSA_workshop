Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. The aim of this workshop is to give a general introduction of using Git for version control and to demonstrate how and why this widely used tool can be used in academic research for anything that changes over time or needs to be shared such as software, papers, and small data sets.

## Is this course for me?

In this workshop we will use Git from the Unix Shell. Some previous experience with the shell will be helpful, but isn’t mandatory.

## Setup and Installation

 * Make sure you can login to a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account or open an account if you don't already have one. 

 * (Alternative 1) - Setup Git and the RStudio interface to Git on your local system.

    * See the `happygitwithr` instructions for installing: [R/RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html) and [Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
