# Version control software (Git) for application in academic research
Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. The aim of this workshop is to give a general introduction of using Git for version control and to demonstrate how and why this widely used tool can be used in academic research for anything that changes over time or needs to be shared such as software, papers, and small data sets.

## Overview

## Learning objectives

## Is this course for me?

## Prework

    - Install R and Rstudio


2. An alternative to (1) if you can't (or don't want to) use your own RStudio system--e.g. a laptop or an institutional server. Shortly before the workshop starts, open up a new project in `rstudio.cloud` by following this link: [rstudio.cloud/project/](https://rstudio.cloud/project/). 
    - You may be prompted to set up an account, which is free. If you already have an account, use that.
    - Your `rstudio.cloud` project is yours and you can leave it for future reference or delete it after the workshop: your choice.
    - Packages will be pre-installed and data will be pre-downloaded on `rstudio.cloud`
